# lcp (or lazycp)

a simple tool that copies and pastes files/folders.  
similar to CTRL+C and CTRL+V.

tbh i only created it cause i didn't find anything else available on github or similar :P

im not saying it doesnt exist, im just saying that i couldnt find anything like this :)

> i wont update it as it suits my needs just now. i will only update it when i need or when it breaks

## usage

`lcp -h` for help (trust me you wont need it)  
`lcp -c ...<files/folders>` to copy  
`lcp -p` to paste  
`lcp -k` to clear """clipboard"""  
`lcp -l` to list files in clipboard
